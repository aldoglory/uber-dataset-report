- 
##  Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed Uber fare data
- Created new time-based features 
- Identified outliers and corrected invalid records
- Built Power BI visualizations

   Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aldoglory/uber-dataset-report
```
Open the cleaned or enhanced dataset in Power BI Desktop.
Explore or modify the dashboard visuals in `uber.pbix`.
