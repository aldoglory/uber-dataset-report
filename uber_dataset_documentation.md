# Uber Fares Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction  
This project explores and analyzes the Uber Fares dataset using Python for preprocessing and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to uncover insights into ride fares, time-based patterns, geographic trends, and to develop an interactive dashboard.

---

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Source  
- **Dataset**: Uber Fares Dataset on Kaggle  
- **Tools Used**: Python (for data cleaning and feature engineering), Power BI Desktop (for visualization)  

### 2.2 Data Loading and Initial Exploration  
- Loaded dataset using `pandas`.  
- Checked structure with `.info()` and `.head()`.

## 3. Data Cleaning  

### 3.1 Handling Missing & Invalid Values  
- Removed rows with missing or invalid values.  using `.isnull().sum()` 

 

### 3.2 Saving Cleaned Data  
- Exported cleaned data to CSV for Power BI.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### 4.1 Descriptive Statistics  
- Analyzed mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles.

### 4.2 Fare Distribution  
- Visualized fare distribution using histograms or boxplots.

### 4.3 Relationship Analysis  
- Explored relationships like fare vs. distance or fare vs. hour.

## 5. Feature Engineering  

### 5.1 Extracting Date-Time Features  
- Created features: `hour`, `day`, `month`, `day_of_week`, `is_peak_hour`.  
 

### 5.2 Exporting for Power BI  
- Exported enhanced dataset as `enhanced_uber.csv`.  



---

## 6. Power BI Visualizations  

### 6.1 Data Import  
- Loaded cleaned and enhanced data into Power BI.  

*(Screenshot: Data loaded in Power BI.)*  

### 6.2 Charts Created  
- **Visualizations**: Fare distribution, monthly ride volume, hourly patterns, geospatial maps.

## 8. Results and Insights  

**Key Discoveries**:  
- Peak hours: Evenings (5–7 PM) and weekends (Friday–Sunday).  
- Busiest location: Manhattan hotspots.  

---

## 9. Conclusion  
Combined Python and Power BI to extract and visualize insights effectively.  

---

## 10. Recommendations  
- Apply surge pricing during peak hours.  
- Offer promotions on off-peak days.  
- Expand service to underserved regions.
